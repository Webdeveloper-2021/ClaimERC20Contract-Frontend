========================== testing proposal =========================

(0) Technologies - React / Angular, Node.JS, Solidity

(1) There must be a file with the list of 5 addresses and the number of tokens in there.

You need to write:

(2) Small SmartContract where there will be addresses and the number of tokens attached to them

(3) On the front client must connect his metamask and:
(3.1) see the number of tokens on his balance
(3.2) claim any amount of tokens to his address from the smart contract address
(3.3) only the wallets among those five can claim tokens

Please:
 ⁃ structure everything in one repo that can be launched on localhost via hardhat.
 ⁃ please provide docs.

=======================================================================

1. Smart contract development using ERC20 and unit testing using hardhat
	
	token name: Test Token
	token symbol: TT

	source: TestToken folder
	- npm install
	- npx hardhat test
	
	Please kindly check readme.txt for deploy and verify
